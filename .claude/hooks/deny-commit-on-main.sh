# PreToolUse(Bash) hook: reads the tool-call JSON on stdin and denies a git
# commit while the checkout is on main (CLAUDE.md: every change lands through
# a PR from a working branch).
#
# The branch of the checkout the hook runs in is only the starting point: a
# compound command may move between branches before it commits, so the branch
# creations (checkout -b/-B / switch -c/-C / switch --create) and the switches
# to main (checkout main / switch main) that precede the first commit are
# replayed by offset, and the commit is denied if that leaves the command on
# main. Branching off first is allowed; switching to main first is denied even
# from a working branch. A creation flag has to stand on its own (-c feat, not
# -cfeat) to count, and "checkout main -- <path>" restores files rather than
# switching. Matching is textual, not a shell parse (docs/ci-jobs.md#hooks),
# and the starting branch is the one of this checkout, so a command that
# commits in another repository (cd elsewhere, git -C) is judged against this
# checkout all the same.
#
# The hook fails closed: on main, a tool call it cannot read (not JSON, or no
# command string) is denied rather than waved through — a verdict must never
# rest on a guess, and here the guess would open the gate. Off main an
# unreadable call is let through: a plain commit there is allowed, and the
# switch to main that would make it one is exactly what cannot be seen —
# silence that leans on ask-before-commit-push-pr.sh asking about the same
# unreadable input; without that hook it would pass unconfirmed.
