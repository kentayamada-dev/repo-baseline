# PreToolUse(Bash) hook: reads the tool-call JSON on stdin and denies a force
# push, a hard reset, or a git clean. The permissions.deny rules in settings.json
# are the prefix forms (git push -f*, git reset --hard*); this hook covers the
# shapes a prefix cannot name: the flag after other arguments or bundled with
# other short flags, options to git itself before the subcommand (git -C dir
# push -f), and the flagless + refspec.
#
# --force\b covers --force-with-lease and --force-if-includes too (the hyphen
# is a word boundary): with main unpushable and every change squash-merged,
# the safer variants have no job here either. git bundles short flags, so -fu
# and -uf are force pushes as much as -f is: any single-dash cluster that holds
# an f counts, which -[a-zA-Z]*f[a-zA-Z]* expresses (a long option starts with
# a second hyphen, so --follow-tags is left alone). A refspec that starts with
# + is a force push carrying no flag at all, so \s\+\S counts as one. Matching
# is textual, not a shell parse (docs/ci-jobs.md#hooks).
#
# git clean is denied in every form, the dry run included, to match the deny
# rule in settings.json: untracked files are uncommitted work too, and a clean
# that deletes nothing tells nothing that git status does not.
#
# The hook fails closed: a tool call it cannot read (not JSON, or no command
# string) is denied rather than waved through — the guarded operations destroy
# pushed history or uncommitted work, so a verdict must never rest on a guess
# that would open the gate.
